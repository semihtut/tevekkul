**Last Updated: January 23, 2026**

## Overview

SoulCount ("we", "our", or "the app") is a spiritual practice and dhikr (remembrance) application designed to help Muslims with their daily worship. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency about our data practices.

## Data Collection

**SoulCount does not collect any personal data.**

All data generated through your use of the app is stored exclusively on your device. We do not:

- Collect personal information (name, email, phone number, etc.)
- Track your location
- Access your contacts, photos, or other device data
- Use analytics or tracking services
- Share any data with third parties
- Store any data on external servers

## Data Stored Locally

The following data is stored only on your device:

- **Dhikr counts and history**: Your prayer counts and progress
- **Favorites**: Your saved dhikrs and Esma-ul Husna
- **Settings**: Theme preference, language selection, sound/haptic preferences
- **Daily Wird (routine)**: Your personalized daily dhikr list
- **Progress statistics**: Streaks, levels, and achievements

This data never leaves your device unless you explicitly choose to export it using the backup feature.

## Data Export/Import

The app provides a backup feature that allows you to:

- Export your data as a JSON file
- Import previously exported data

This feature is entirely under your control. Exported files are saved to your device's storage and are not transmitted to any external servers.

Since all data is stored locally on your device:

- Your data is protected by your device's security features (passcode, Face ID, Touch ID)
- Uninstalling the app will permanently delete all associated data
- We recommend using your device's built-in backup features (iCloud, iTunes) if you wish to preserve your data
